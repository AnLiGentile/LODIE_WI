### Introduction ###

This project provides methods to learn website wrappers.
The assumptions are:
- we have a given Knowledge base K (e.g. DBpedia)
- we want to extract instances of a particular concept C and its attributes (as defined in K)
- there is a fixed domain D (e.g. Book) D ={d<sub>1</sub> â€¦ d<sub>n</sub>} where each d<sub>i</sub> is a set of homogeneous *entity-centric* webpages i.e.:
-- each webpage in d<sub>i</sub> belongs to the same website (and share a common template)
-- each webpage in d<sub>i</sub> describes one entity e of type C

The method takes as input a set of homogeneous *entity-centric* webpages d<sub>i</sub> describing entities of type C; for each attribute to extract the method takes as input a gazetteer with possible values for the attribute, obtained from K.
Each gazetteer can be constructed with varying degrees of complexity, from simple SPARQL query, to more complex ones, can be cleaned with outlier detection strategies etc. In this project the gazetteers are assumed given; facilities to generate gazetteers will be released separately.
The method generates:
- a set of xpath extractors (the cardinality of the set can be 0, 1 or multiple)
- results of the extraction performed on d<sub>i</sub> applying the xpath extractors.

### Resources ###
The folder [resources](./resources) contains:
- [gazetteers](./resources/gazetteers) that are used to seed the annotation phase. These gazetteers have been automatically generated, but are given as static resource here for reproducibility. Relevant gazetteers are provided for all domain-attributes tackled in the the evaluation [datasets](./resources/datasets)
- evaluation [datasets](./resources/datasets) with the relative groundtruth
- the [temp](./temp) folder is the default location where the method creates intermediate representations of pages.

The folder [experimentResults](./experimentResults) is the default location where the method saves experimental results.

### Workflow ###
Input is provided as follows:
- a folder D which represents the domain and contains subfolders d<sub>i</sub> containing a set of homogeneous *entity-centric* webpages; each webpage is a single html file
- *for test purposes* we provide example files for the book domain; the folder [book](./resources/datasets/swde-17477/testset/book) 
the subfolders [book-booksamillion-2000](./resources/datasets/swde-17477/testset/book/book-booksamillion-2000) and [book-christianbook-2000](./resources/datasets/swde-17477/testset/book/book-christianbook-2000) contains 2000 pages each, describing books, respectively from http://www.booksamillion.com/ and http://www.christianbook.com/ websites.

The original webpages are transformed in an internal xpath-value representation where:
- we extract all text nodes for each page
- we save the page as the collection of its text nodes, as pairs of <xpath expression to reach the node - text content of the node>
- the internal xpath-value representation of pages can be obtained using methods provided in the class [ReducePagesToXpath](./src/uk/ac/shef/dcs/oak/xpath/processors/ReducePagesToXpath.java)
- *for test purposes* the main method in [ReducePagesToXpath](./src/uk/ac/shef/dcs/oak/xpath/processors/ReducePagesToXpath.java) will produce the xpath-value representation of [book](./resources/datasets/swde-17477/testset/book) and save it in the [temp](./temp) folder.
